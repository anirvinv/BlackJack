## Instructions

There are two players in this game:

- `You`
- `The Dealer` (the script)

You and the dealer start off with 0 points. Each card is worth its face value and J,Q,K are worth 10,11 and 12 points. You can pick the value of ace to be 1 or 11 points during the game. You can choose to hit or stay during each turn. If you hit, you can add an unknown card to your pile. If you stay, the dealer adds it to their pile. If you either of you get to 21 points, its an immediate win. If anyone goes over, its an immediate loss.
